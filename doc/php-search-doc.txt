Introduction *php-search-doc-introduction*

When your cursor is on something you would look up on php.net, type:

- <Leader>pf for function help
- <Leader>pm for manual search

and the plugin will open a new tab in your browser (or a
new instance of the browser) to the related docs. See the following section
for changing mappings.

Configuration *php-search-doc-configuration* *g:php_search_doc_php_command*
*g:php_search_doc_mapping*

By default, the plugin uses the open command to look up the docs but you
can easily change the command. For example, if you are on *NIX you would like to
change it:

    let g:php_search_doc_command='xdg-open'

Furthermore you can choose your own mapping in the following way:

    let g:php_search_doc_manual_mapping='KK'

There are g:php_search_doc_function_mapping and g:php_search_doc_manual_mapping
variables available.
